# IPC 144(Introduction to Programming Using C) Final Project
I built a patient appointment system for a veterinary clinic using C.

- Managed patient contact information and implemented functionality for scheduling and managing appointments.
- Completed multiple milestones to gradually build and enhance the system.
- Milestone 1 focused on core module development, including menu systems and basic display functions.
- Milestone 2 centered around patient management, creating data structures and defining functions for patient-related tasks.
- Milestone 3 extended the system to include appointment management, allowing scheduling and tracking of patient appointments.
